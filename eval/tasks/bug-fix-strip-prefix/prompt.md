Fix the incorrect behavior of strip_prefix without changing its signature. Add a small regression test in test_solution.py.

Work only in the supplied task workspace. Edit solution.py and public tests; use Python 3.11+ and the standard library. Do not access parent repositories or external services.

Public behavior:
Remove exactly one matching prefix. A nonmatching or empty prefix leaves text unchanged. Do not strip individual characters or repeated prefixes.

Maintain type hints. Do not mutate input collections. No algorithmic complexity constraint is imposed. Verify with python -m unittest discover -v.

Submission requirements: test_solution.py must contain at least 1 passing unittest test methods exercising the public API. Retain all behavior and compatibility requirements above.
