Repair runs. Also add its public specification as a docstring, add regression tests in test_solution.py, and preserve input values and collection order as specified.

Work only in the supplied task workspace. Edit solution.py and public tests; use Python 3.11+ and the standard library. Do not access parent repositories or external services.

Public behavior:
Run-length encode adjacent equal strings as (value,count) pairs. Nonadjacent equal values form separate runs. Empty input returns [].

Maintain type hints. Do not mutate input collections. No algorithmic complexity constraint is imposed. Verify with python -m unittest discover -v.

Submission requirements: test_solution.py must contain at least 3 passing unittest test methods exercising the public API. Retain all behavior and compatibility requirements above.
